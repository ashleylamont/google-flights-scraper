# Google Flights -> Outline Scraper

This is a small utility I hacked together to help me and friends plan trips.

It scrapes the Google Flights website and returns a list of flights and their prices.

Then it uploads that data to my personal outline server via the API.

It's a bit slow and janky, but it works :)

You'll need to make sure you're running this with a framebuffer of some kind (xvfb works) for *some reason* ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
